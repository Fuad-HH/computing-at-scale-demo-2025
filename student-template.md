## Research Interests
I'm interested in creating multiscale and multiphysics simulations that can run on exascale supercomputers. My group develops two main technologies. The first is called the Parallel Coupler for Multimodel Simulations [(PCMS)](https://github.com/SCOREC/pcms) which is primarily used for multiphysics coupling of fusion simulations. Second, we develop a multiscale framework called [MuMFiM](https://github.com/SCOREC/mumfim) that is used for hierarchical parallel simulations. We are expecting to release a completely rewritten version of MuMFiM in the next two years.
