# Matrix-Matrix or Matrix-Vector Multiplication
This file consist of instruction on how to compile and execute the codes. Also some references and git links that I used.

## 1. Create build and make file
Run this command on the directory with all the other files:
\> cmake -S . -B build

###### note : The version I am using is 3.28.3 for cmake. So, you might need to adjust and make changes as per your system's requirement. 

## 2. Change the directory to build and compile
\> cd build
\> make

## 3. Execute the main executable
\> ./main <file1.mtx> <file2.mtx> <var>
###### note : here file1.mtx is a matrix file while file2.mtx can be both matrix or vector. For matrix-matrix multiplication choose var = 1 amd for matrix-vector multiplication choose var = 0. To run the executable you will need to add the .mtx files in build directory.
